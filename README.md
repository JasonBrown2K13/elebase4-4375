Browser combinations are unknown (this data was provided by the users), however Google Chrome was the most commonly-used desktop browser in the resting and Apple Safari was the most commonly-used mobile browser in the testing. 

## Known bugs

The fixed menu at the bottom of the prototype can sometimes be slightly hidden (not enough to hinder the user experience, however) when using Google Chrome or Samsung Internet Browser on a Samsung Android device, such as the Galaxy S8 used to test this prototype. This issue was not present in Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Edge for Android. 

The page does not display correctly in any version of Internet Explorer due to the way that Siemma (a crtitical component of the Elebase framework) is rendered.
